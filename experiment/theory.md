In an automation project loop wiring diagram plays important role. The details about importance of loop wiring diagrams, the procedure to follow, and the standards used for preparing one for an automation project is detailed as below:

##### Importance of Loop Wiring Diagrams

A loop wiring diagram is a critical document in an automation project that shows the electrical connections between devices and the PLC (Programmable Logic Controller). It is essential for several reasons:

##### Clarity and Understanding: 
A loop wiring diagram provides a clear and concise understanding of the electrical connections between devices and the PLC, making it easier to troubleshoot and maintain the system.

##### Error Reduction:
A well-prepared loop wiring diagram reduces the likelihood of errors during installation, commissioning, and maintenance, which can lead to costly downtime and repairs.

##### Improved Safety: 
A loop wiring diagram helps ensure that the electrical connections are safe and meet the required safety standards, reducing the risk of electrical shocks, fires, and other hazards.

##### Efficient Troubleshooting:
A loop wiring diagram enables quick and efficient troubleshooting, reducing downtime and increasing overall system reliability.

##### Compliance with Standards: 
A loop wiring diagram helps ensure compliance with relevant industry standards and regulations, such as IEC 61131, ISA 5.1, and NFPA 79.

##### Procedure to Follow

To prepare a loop wiring diagram, follow these steps:

##### Gather Information: 

Collect all relevant information about the devices, PLC, and electrical connections, including device specifications, wiring diagrams, and PLC programming.

##### Determine the Loop Configuration: 

Determine the loop configuration, including the number of loops, devices, and PLC connections.

##### Create the Diagram: 

Create the loop wiring diagram using a standardized symbol set and notation, such as IEC 61131 or ISA 5.1.

##### Verify and Validate: 

Verify and validate the diagram against the actual installation and PLC programming.

##### Document and Archive: 
 
Document and archive the loop wiring diagram, including any revisions or updates.

##### Standards Used

Several standards are used for preparing loop wiring diagrams, including:

##### IEC 61131: 

International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard for programmable controllers and their associated peripherals.

##### ISA 5.1:  

International Society of Automation (ISA) standard for instrumentation symbols and identification.

##### NFPA 79: 

National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standard for electrical safety in industrial machinery.

##### IEEE 315:  

Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard for graphic symbols for electrical diagrams.

##### ANSI/ISA 5.2: 

American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and ISA standard for binary logic diagrams.

##### Best Practices

-	To ensure a high-quality loop wiring diagram, follow these best practices:
-	Use Standardized Symbols and Notation: Use standardized symbols and notation to ensure clarity and consistency.
-	Keep the Diagram Simple and Concise: Keep the diagram simple and concise, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
-	Verify and Validate: Verify and validate the diagram against the actual installation and PLC programming.
-	Document and Archive: Document and archive the loop wiring diagram, including any revisions or updates.
-	Use a Consistent Layout: Use a consistent layout and organization to make the diagram easy to read and understand.

By following these guidelines, you can create a high-quality loop wiring diagram that meets industry standards and ensures a safe, efficient, and reliable automation system.
